Comparison-

Backtracking:
Time Complexity: O(2n), where n is the number of items. This is because it explores all possible combinations of items.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack.
Performance: This approach is inefficient for larger problems, as it explores every subset of items, making it unsuitable for large datasets.

Branch and Bound:
Time Complexity: O(2n) in the worst case. However, it can be much better than backtracking due to pruning, making it more efficient in practice.
Space Complexity: O(n) for the recursion stack.
Performance: Branch and Bound reduces the search space by pruning, which improves the performance compared to pure backtracking, but it is still exponential in the worst case.

Dynamic Programming:
Time Complexity: O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the knapsack capacity.
Space Complexity: O(nW) for the DP table.
Performance: This is the most efficient approach among the three, particularly when the problem size grows large. 
The DP approach guarantees optimal solutions in polynomial time, making it the best for solving knapsack problems with large inputs.
